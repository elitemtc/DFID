# DFID: David Filament RFID 
The DFID is a proposal to store and transfer the filament configuration data with an RFID chip. It is an open implementation and supported by the DMS(David Multi-material System). 
The idea of this ID scheme is for the convenient using of the filament information. Although certain level of security is implemented, it does not go extreme considering the cost may be involved. With RSA1024, the counterfeit ID has been reasonably prevented, however, the ID clone is still possible.
